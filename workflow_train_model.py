# Train the recommender model using a Gradient Workflow
#
# This script is minimally commented because it is called from and explained by
# the recommender project notebook, deep_learning_recommender_tf.ipynb
#
# Code is the minimal subset of the notebook to perform the steps
#
# Lines are the same as the notebook, except where they need to be changed to
# work in a .py script as opposed to a .ipynb notebook
