    "# Deep Learning Recommenders in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Nick Ball  \n",
    "Data-Scientist-in-Residence, Paperspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Last updated: Nov 12th 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "This self-contained notebook shows the use of Paperspace Gradient to implement a recommender system using TensorFlow. It accompanies the 6-part blog series \"Gradient End-to-End: A Recommender System using Notebooks and Workflows\" on the [Paperspace blog](https://blog.paperspace.com), and the associated [Git Repository](https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes these main highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show a real-world-style example of machine learning on Gradient\n",
    "2. End-to-end dataflow incorporating both Gradient Notebooks and Workflows\n",
    "3. Modern data science methodology based on Gradient's integrations with Git\n",
    "4. Use TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) to train a recommender model that includes deep learning\n",
    "5. Use training data that reflects what real-world projects deal with (not just demo data)\n",
    "6. Construct a custom model using the full TensorFlow subclassing API\n",
    "7. Show working hyperparameter tuning that improves the results\n",
    "8. Deploy model using Gradient Deployments and its TensorFlow Serving integrations\n",
    "9. Accompanying material: self-contained working Jupyter notebook, and Git repository\n",
    "10. Aimed at a broad technical audience: data scientists who are not engineers, engineers who are not data scientists, those who span the two disciplines, and others\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is not a complete enterprise-grade recommender system: they would typically take teams of several people months to construct, and result in an amount of code far greater than shown here, but it aims to be more than just a simple demonstration or toy model, by showcasing real data science techniques. In the Appendix we discuss some of the steps one might take to go from the project here to a full system, with a focus on Gradient's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the reader of this notebook is somewhat technical, but not necessarily an expert in recommender systems, deep learning, TensorFlow, or Paperspace."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to run on Paperspace Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    " - In the Gradient GUI, create a Project with a name, e.g., Deep Learning Recommender\n",
    " - Within the project, create a Notebook with the following settings:\n",
    "   - Don't select any of the boxes under Select a runtime\n",
    "   - Select a machine = C4 (C5, P4000, etc., will also work)\n",
    "   - Public/private = set to preferred option\n",
    "   - Under Advanced options:\n",
    "     - Set the Workspace URL field to https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF to point to this repository.\n",
    "     - Set the Container name field to `tensorflow/tensorflow:2.4.1-gpu-jupyter`\n",
    "     - Set the Container command to `jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.trust_xheaders=True --NotebookApp.disable_check_xsrf=False --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*'`\n",
    "     - The other options can remain the same.\n",
    " - Start the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Notebook has started, click `deep_learning_recommender_tf.ipynb` to run in the usual way by clicking Run under each cell in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook creation can also be done on the command line if desired, via gradient notebooks create. For more details on Notebooks, see the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can clone the Git repository and run in your own notebook setup\n",
    "\n",
    " - `git clone https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF.git` (the repo is public, so Git's ssh command form is not required)\n",
    " - Be able to run Python 3, and import modules as in Section 2 below: Matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow 2, TFDS, TFRS\n",
    " - We use some notebook cell magic lines, such as `%matplotlib`"

    "### Additional requirements to run Gradient Workflows and model deployment (sections 4.3+)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, to run the Gradient Workflows in section 4.3 and the model deployment in section 5 requires some more setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is optional:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use or create a [Gradient Private Cluster](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/gradient-private-cloud/about/setup/managed-installation) and [get its ID](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/gradient-private-cloud/about/usage#finding-your-cluster-id). If no cluster ID is specified, the Gradient public cluster will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements will remain, being associated with Workflows as the enterprise-grade production part of Gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Create a project](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects#create-a-project) and [get its ID](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects#get-your-projects-id)\n",
    " - [Generate an API key](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli#obtaining-an-api-key) for your project to allow access\n",
    " - [Store the API key](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects/storing-an-api-key-as-a-secret) as a secret in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will go away as the product matures around Workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Create the two workflows](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows#creating-gradient-workflows) named `recommender-train-model` and `recommender-deploy-model`, and [get their IDs](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows#running-your-first-workflow-run)\n",
    " - [Create an output dataset](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/data/data-overview/private-datasets-repository#creating-a-dataset-and-dataset-version) for the training workflow, named `recommender`\n",
    " \n",
    "The create workflow step and create output dataset can be done via the GUI, or the [command line interface](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli) (CLI). The commands for the latter look like\n",
    "\n",
    "`gradient storageProviders list --apiKey <your API key>` \n",
    " \n",
    "Note the `storage provider ID` for **Gradient Managed** storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "`gradient datasets create --name recommender --storageProviderId <your storage provider ID> --apiKey <your API key>`  \n",
    "`gradient workflows create --name Recommender-Train-Model --projectId <your project ID> --apiKey <your API key>`  \n",
    "`gradient workflows create --name Recommender-Deploy-Model --projectId <your project ID> --apiKey <your API key>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of `--apiKey` on the command line is optional: you can also store a key in a JSON file, e.g., `~/.paperspace/config.json` to avoid having to add it to each command. Here we leave it present. Another option is the environment variable `PAPERSPACE_API_KEY`. See [connecting your account](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli#connecting-your-account) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one thing that is *not* required for this project is any setup on your own machine, unless you choose to use the CLI. This is because the Workflows are invoked from this Notebook, via the SDK."
