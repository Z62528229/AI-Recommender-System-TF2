    "This self-contained notebook shows the use of Paperspace Gradient to implement a recommender system using TensorFlow. It accompanies the 6-part blog series \"Gradient End-to-End: A Recommender System using Notebooks and Workflows\" on the [Paperspace blog](https://blog.paperspace.com), and the associated [Git Repository](https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes these main highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show a real-world-style example of machine learning on Gradient\n",
    "2. End-to-end dataflow incorporating both Gradient Notebooks and Workflows\n",
    "3. Modern data science methodology based on Gradient's integrations with Git\n",
    "4. Use TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) to train a recommender model that includes deep learning\n",
    "5. Use training data that reflects what real-world projects deal with (not just demo data)\n",
    "6. Construct a custom model using the full TensorFlow subclassing API\n",
    "7. Show working hyperparameter tuning that improves the results\n",
