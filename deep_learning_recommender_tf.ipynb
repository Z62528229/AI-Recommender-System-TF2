    "# Deep Learning Recommenders in TensorFlow\n",

    "This self-contained notebook shows the use of Paperspace Gradient to implement a recommender system using TensorFlow. It accompanies the 6-part blog series \"Gradient End-to-End: A Recommender System using Notebooks and Workflows\" on the [Paperspace blog](https://blog.paperspace.com), and the associated [Git Repository](https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes these main highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show a real-world-style example of machine learning on Gradient\n",
    "2. End-to-end dataflow incorporating both Gradient Notebooks and Workflows\n",
    "3. Modern data science methodology based on Gradient's integrations with Git\n",
    "4. Use TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) to train a recommender model that includes deep learning\n",
    "5. Use training data that reflects what real-world projects deal with (not just demo data)\n",
    "6. Construct a custom model using the full TensorFlow subclassing API\n",
    "7. Show working hyperparameter tuning that improves the results\n",
    "8. Deploy model using Gradient Deployments and its TensorFlow Serving integrations\n",
    "9. Accompanying material: self-contained working Jupyter notebook, and Git repository\n",
    "10. Aimed at a broad technical audience: data scientists who are not engineers, engineers who are not data scientists, those who span the two disciplines, and others\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is not a complete enterprise-grade recommender system: they would typically take teams of several people months to construct, and result in an amount of code far greater than shown here, but it aims to be more than just a simple demonstration or toy model, by showcasing real data science techniques. In the Appendix we discuss some of the steps one might take to go from the project here to a full system, with a focus on Gradient's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the reader of this notebook is somewhat technical, but not necessarily an expert in recommender systems, deep learning, TensorFlow, or Paperspace."
