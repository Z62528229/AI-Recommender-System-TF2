    "This self-contained notebook shows the use of Paperspace Gradient to implement a recommender system using TensorFlow. It accompanies the 6-part blog series \"Gradient End-to-End: A Recommender System using Notebooks and Workflows\" on the [Paperspace blog](https://blog.paperspace.com), and the associated [Git Repository](https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes these main highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show a real-world-style example of machine learning on Gradient\n",
    "2. End-to-end dataflow incorporating both Gradient Notebooks and Workflows\n",
    "3. Modern data science methodology based on Gradient's integrations with Git\n",
    "4. Use TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) to train a recommender model that includes deep learning\n",
    "5. Use training data that reflects what real-world projects deal with (not just demo data)\n",
    "6. Construct a custom model using the full TensorFlow subclassing API\n",
    "7. Show working hyperparameter tuning that improves the results\n",
    "8. Deploy model using Gradient Deployments and its TensorFlow Serving integrations\n",
    "9. Accompanying material: self-contained working Jupyter notebook, and Git repository\n",
    "10. Aimed at a broad technical audience: data scientists who are not engineers, engineers who are not data scientists, those who span the two disciplines, and others\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is not a complete enterprise-grade recommender system: they would typically take teams of several people months to construct, and result in an amount of code far greater than shown here, but it aims to be more than just a simple demonstration or toy model, by showcasing real data science techniques. In the Appendix we discuss some of the steps one might take to go from the project here to a full system, with a focus on Gradient's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the reader of this notebook is somewhat technical, but not necessarily an expert in recommender systems, deep learning, TensorFlow, or Paperspace."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to run on Paperspace Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    " - In the Gradient GUI, create a Project with a name, e.g., Deep Learning Recommender\n",
    " - Within the project, create a Notebook with the following settings:\n",
    "   - Don't select any of the boxes under Select a runtime\n",
    "   - Select a machine = C4 (C5, P4000, etc., will also work)\n",
    "   - Public/private = set to preferred option\n",
    "   - Under Advanced options:\n",
    "     - Set the Workspace URL field to https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF to point to this repository.\n",
    "     - Set the Container name field to `tensorflow/tensorflow:2.4.1-gpu-jupyter`\n",
    "     - Set the Container command to `jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.trust_xheaders=True --NotebookApp.disable_check_xsrf=False --NotebookApp.allow_remote_access=True --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*'`\n",
    "     - The other options can remain the same.\n",
    " - Start the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Notebook has started, click `deep_learning_recommender_tf.ipynb` to run in the usual way by clicking Run under each cell in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook creation can also be done on the command line if desired, via gradient notebooks create. For more details on Notebooks, see the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can clone the Git repository and run in your own notebook setup\n",
    "\n",
    " - `git clone https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF.git` (the repo is public, so Git's ssh command form is not required)\n",
    " - Be able to run Python 3, and import modules as in Section 2 below: Matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow 2, TFDS, TFRS\n",
    " - We use some notebook cell magic lines, such as `%matplotlib`"

    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, to run the Gradient Workflows in section 4.3 and the model deployment in section 5 requires some more setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "These requirements will remain, being associated with Workflows as the enterprise-grade production part of Gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Create a project](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects#create-a-project) and [get its ID](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects#get-your-projects-id)\n",
    " - [Generate an API key](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli#obtaining-an-api-key) for your project to allow access\n",
    " - [Store the API key](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/managing-projects/storing-an-api-key-as-a-secret) as a secret in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will go away as the product matures around Workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Create the two workflows](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows#creating-gradient-workflows) named `recommender-train-model` and `recommender-deploy-model`, and [get their IDs](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/explore-train-deploy/workflows/getting-started-with-workflows#running-your-first-workflow-run)\n",
    " - [Create an output dataset](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/data/data-overview/private-datasets-repository#creating-a-dataset-and-dataset-version) for the training workflow, named `recommender`\n",
    " \n",
    "The create workflow step and create output dataset can be done via the GUI, or the [command line interface](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli) (CLI). The commands for the latter look like\n",
    "\n",
    "`gradient storageProviders list --apiKey <your API key>` \n",

    "The usage of `--apiKey` on the command line is optional: you can also store a key in a JSON file, e.g., `~/.paperspace/config.json` to avoid having to add it to each command. Here we leave it present. Another option is the environment variable `PAPERSPACE_API_KEY`. See [connecting your account](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/quick-start/install-the-cli#connecting-your-account) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one thing that is *not* required for this project is any setup on your own machine, unless you choose to use the CLI. This is because the Workflows are invoked from this Notebook, via the SDK."

    "## 1: Introduction: Recommender systems and deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to describe most recommender systems is:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Present suggested new items to a user that users similar to them already liked.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is on the assumption that if users similar to them liked something, there is a better-than-random chance that they will like it too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short sentence above involves several concepts, including information about a user, how to measure if they are similar to another user, what items the other users liked, how to choose candidate items to present from the whole list, and how to rank those choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "(There are further ideas as well, such as whether a user rated an item explicitly or just implicitly liked it by watching or buying it, and using other similarities such as item-item as well as user-user similarity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use the well-known MovieLens dataset, containing information about which movies users watched, along with details of the movies, the users, and the times of viewing. The idea is to present to a user suggested movies that they might like to watch next.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not a huge modern dataset with millions of viewings from millions of users, it has been widely used, and is \"real enough\" to show both how deep learning can improve recommender models, and how to set up and end-to-end data science workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of this notebook is based on the tutorials of the [TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) library](https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders), modified to include more real-world data science steps, and showing a model being deployed into production.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described there, recommender models commonly consist of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Retrieval, which selects possible candidates from the whole list of items that could be recommended, in this case being movies the user might be interested in\n",
    " - Ranking, which narrows down this list to a refined set of items to recommend\n",
    "\n",
    "We concentrate on the ranking portion, showing how the addition of deep learning layers, data features, and hyperparameter tuning, improves the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then show how the resulting model can be easily deployed with Gradient Deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concentration on just one part of the models to be built is so that we can show more fully realized data science steps, the end-to-end process using both Gradient Notebooks and Workflows, and some of the corresponding functionaity, without the project becoming overly long or repetitive."

    "\n",
    "This project uses [TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) and the TensorFlow Recommenders library (TFRS) in addition to the basic TensorFlow 2 and Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFRS was created as a separate library because recommender systems typically do not correspond to the simple setup of supervised learning models, but have a more complex arrangement of processing steps associated with them. So rather than using a few layers in the high-level TensorFlow Keras Sequential or [Functional](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional) APIs, they need the custom model and custom layer setup in the lower level representation of writing the model classes and subclasses directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recommenders do contain their own common components, such as the FactorizedTopK performance metric for retrieval, that mean usage of a library is considerably more convenient than writing something from scratch in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use TensorFlow Datasets as the emphases in this project are recommenders, Gradient functionality, end-to-end, and showing some model tuning, rather than data gathering, cleaning, and preparation. Of course, in a full enterprise system this would be a more prominent aspect of the dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install TFDS, TFRS, and import these and the Python modules that we need."
