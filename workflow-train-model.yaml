# Part of the project "Gradient End-to-End: A Recommender System using Notebooks and Workflows"
# at https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/get-started/tutorials-list/end-to-end-example
# See that URL for instructions on how to use
# This file is called from the Gradient Notebook deep_learning_recommender_tf.ipynb
# In turn, this file calls workflow_train_model.py
# A trained model is output, which is then deployed in the following section of the Notebook
# The project GitHub repository, which includes this file, is at https://github.com/gradient-ai/Deep-Learning-Recommender-TF
